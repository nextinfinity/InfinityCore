# InfinityCore

InfinityCore is a Minecraft game core created to drastically speed up minigame development time by reducing the amount of boilerplate needed (in some cases, by up to or even
exceeding 60%). InfinityCore provides the basic arena and class architecture so it is not necessary to implement these from scratch while including modern features such as
arena and class selection menus. Furthermore, InfinityCore is easily extensible to allow for custom minigame features.

## Getting Started

A more detailed usage guide will be provided in the near future. See [SuperCraftBros](https://github.com/nextinfinity/SuperCraftBros) as an example of InfinityCore in use.
Furthermore, documentation is available in the [Javadoc](https://nextinfinity.github.io/InfinityCore).
